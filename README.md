# resume
The project files that I use to construct my resume using CSS Grid and CSS print styles.

Future Work:
- pulling in content from a data file, separating the content from the HTML structure
- generating the PDF result via a task runner like Gulp, rather than manually from my browser
- screen specfic styles to make it more interactive
